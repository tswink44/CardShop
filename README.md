# CardShop
A quick project I made to demonstrate my skill in UI and web front-end and back-end development. This project uses a React.JS front-end and a FASTAPI python backend.

CardShop is a simulated website for trading cards. It aims to provide its users with a one-stop location to buy their favorite cards. Cards can be sold both by the store owner or can faciliate peer-to-peer transactions between users.

## Features
-Homepage that dynamically displays featured products and customer testimonials. Footer provides links to website ToS and social media.

-Store page displays listings that can be generated by any user.

-Ability to add cards to cart and perform a simulated checkout

-Login and registration system with session and JWT token management

- Profile page that allows normal users to create new listings.

- Admin panel that allows admins to edit or delete listings.


## TO-DO
- Implement a user profile avatar

- Implement product and user (seller) reviews

- Implement more robust simulated checkout

- Allow submission of customer user testimonials
